## 🚀 Future Plans <br>
I'm cooking up some exciting enhancements to make Recipe Picker smarter, healthier, and more personal: <br>

🥗 Diet & Health Filters – Options for vegan, gluten-free, keto, or high-protein recipes. <br>
❤️ Personalized Recommendations – AI-based suggestions based on your saved favorites & cooking history. <br>
🌍 Cultural Cuisines – Filter recipes by global cuisines (Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, etc.). <br>
👩‍🍳 Community Recipes – Allow users to submit their own recipes and share with others. <br>
🛒 Smart Pantry Sync – Connect with a virtual pantry tracker to suggest recipes as ingredients run low. <br>
